    "text": "Louie stood before the tightrope. Her heart hammered with excitement. The rope stretched between two trees, three metres off the ground. It swayed slightly in the breeze. She was going to walk it."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "Ned stared up at her, his eyes wide. “You ain’t getting up on that?” he said. “It isn’t safe, Louie. You can’t just get up on the rope and … well … do it. It’s a proper skill. It takes years of practice!”"
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "Louie just grinned. For weeks she had been getting up before dawn to practise in secret. Every morning, while Ned was snoring away in his cosy bed, she had come here to balance, to learn, to dream. This was her chance to prove she could be more than just a ticket girl at the circus. She could be a performer — maybe even as great as her hero, Blondin, the man who had once walked a tightrope across Niagara Falls."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "She kicked off her clogs, tied her hair back with a piece of ribbon and asked Ned to give her a leg-up. He cupped his hands and lifted her towards the rope. Louie pushed off, balanced on her stomach for a moment and then carefully swung one leg over, gripping the rope between her feet."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "“Now step back and watch,” she called, her voice steady though her insides fizzed with nerves."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "Ned stepped back. Louie looked down at him — and immediately wished she hadn’t. The rope felt narrower than ever. Her stomach flipped. She swallowed hard, fixed her eyes on the far tree and breathed. Focus, Louie."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "Arms out to the side, she took her first step. The rope trembled beneath her foot, but she didn’t wobble. She took another. And another. The world seemed to hold its breath. Then she began to move more smoothly, one foot placed carefully in front of the other."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "After a few metres, her fear melted into exhilaration. It felt good to be watched. It made her think harder about how she moved. She tried to make more of a show of it — stretching out each leg in turn, flourishing her wrists like a dancer."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "When she reached the end, she paused and looked down at Ned. He was staring, open-mouthed. Louie grinned. The flames were there inside her — excitement, pride, triumph. This was what she was meant to do."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "She turned, steadied herself, and walked back across the rope, quicker this time. When she reached the middle, she leaned one hand on the tree trunk and laughed. Ned finally found his voice. “You did it!” he shouted. Louie hopped lightly down onto the grass and bowed. “Told you,” she said. “I’m going to be the girl who walks on air.”"
