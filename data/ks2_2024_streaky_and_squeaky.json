      "text": "Imagine treading through the rainforest in Madagascar and noticing hurried movements in the plants below you. You creep forward to investigate. Suddenly, you see a group of animals unlike anything that you have seen before. Ten of them are sniffing along the ground with long, pointy snouts that look almost like bird beaks. The creatures are quite small – maybe the size of a pet hamster. Their bodies are round and covered with spines like a hedgehog. They are brightly coloured like a bumblebee with yellow streaks running down their backs and legs. On their heads, each of the animals has a crown of bright yellow spikes."

      "text": "They are not hedgehogs, birds or bumblebees, even if they look like a confused hodgepodge of these animals. You have encountered a family of lowland streaked tenrecs. They are one of many species of tenrecs living in Madagascar."

      "text": "Tenrecs forage in the rainforest for soft-bodied invertebrates such as worms and beetle larvae. They sometimes stamp on the ground with their forepaws, to create vibrations, which may increase earthworm activity. They have very fragile jawbones and can only eat soft food. If they tried to eat anything harder, it could damage or even break their jaws."

      "type": "paragraph",

As a result of deforestation, where humans cut down the rainforest for wood, tenrecs are in decline. Streaked tenrecs play an important role in their habitat as they hunt smaller creatures and are prey for larger animals like birds and snakes. Without tenrecs, the whole food-chain could be disrupted, causing serious problems for wildlife in Madagascar."
