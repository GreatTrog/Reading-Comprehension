    "text": "I first saw the leopard when I was crossing the small stream at the bottom of the hill. As I began climbing, the grunting and chattering increased, as though the monkeys were trying to warn me of some hidden danger. A shower of pebbles came rattling down the steep hillside, and I looked up to see a sinewy, orange-gold leopard poised on a rock about twenty feet above me."
  },
  {
    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "He was not looking toward me, but had his head thrust attentively forward. Yet he must have sensed my presence, because he slowly turned his head and looked down at me. He seemed a little puzzled at my presence there; and when, to give myself courage, I clapped my hands sharply, the leopard sprang away into the thickets, making absolutely no sound as he melted into the shadows. I had disturbed the animal in his quest for food. But a little later I heard the quickening cry of a deer as it fled through the forest. The hunt was still on."

    "type": "paragraph",
    "text": "The leopard, like other members of the cat family, is nearing extinction in India, and I was surprised to find one so close to Mussoorie. It was some weeks before I saw the leopard again, although I was often aware of its presence. A dry, rasping cough sometimes gave it away. At times I felt almost certain that I was being followed. Once, when I was late getting home, and the brief twilight gave way to a dark, moonless night, I was startled by a family of porcupines running about in a clearing. I looked around nervously, and saw two bright eyes staring at me from a thicket. I stood still, my heart banging away against my ribs. Then the eyes danced away, and I realised that they were only fireflies."

    "type": "paragraph",

    "text": "Leopard skins, they told me, were selling in Delhi for very good money. Of course there was a ban on the export of skins, but they gave me to understand that there were ways and means. I thanked them for their information and walked on, feeling uneasy and disturbed."

    "type": "paragraph",

But there was something else of which I was becoming increasingly aware: the strong feline odour of one of the cat family. I paused, and listened. There was no movement. The leopard was in there, I was sure, but he too was silent, watching me, aware of me."

I did not seek physical contact, or even another glimpse of that beautiful, sinewy body, springing from rock to rock. It was his trust I wanted, and I think he gave it to me."
