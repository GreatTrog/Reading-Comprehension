          <h2 id="passage-title">The Lighthouse Keeper's Secret</h2>
          <p>
            The town of Gullhaven sits on the edge of a cliff, watching the
            restless sea. At dawn each day the villagers wake to the steady wink
            of Lantern Point Lighthouse. For years, the keeper, Mrs. Calder,
            kept the light blazing even when storms tried to swallow it whole.
            Children said she could whisper to the waves; fishermen swore she
            knew which gulls carried the gossip of the sea.
          </p>
          <p>
            One autumn, a new apprentice named Rafi arrived with questions as
            tall as the tide. Mrs. Calder welcomed the help but warned him:
            &ldquo;Every light has a story, and ours is still being written.&rdquo;
            Rafi soon noticed strange deliveries&mdash;boxes of clockwork parts,
            rolls of copper wire, jars of glow-lantern algae. Late at night, he
            heard humming from the workshop beneath the lamp room.
          </p>
          <h3>The Midnight Experiment</h3>
          <p>
            Curious, Rafi followed the glow one fog-laden midnight. Mrs. Calder
            stood beside a contraption of gears and mirrors shaped like a
            seashell. &ldquo;It will help the light bend,&rdquo; she explained,
            &ldquo;so it can reach ships hidden by the thickest fog.&rdquo;
            Together they tuned the mirrors until the beam stretched farther
            than ever before. The next morning, sailors reported that the sea
            seemed to shine with its own lantern.
          </p>
          <p>
            Word of the lighthouse's new power spread beyond Gullhaven. Some
            visitors came to marvel; others came seeking to buy the invention.
            Mrs. Calder refused. &ldquo;This light belongs to everyone who needs
            it,&rdquo; she said. Rafi realized the real secret of Lantern Point
            was not a machine, but the keeper's promise to guide every traveler,
            even the unseen ones.
          </p>
          <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
          <p>
            Winter approached, and with it, storms fiercer than any in
            memory. Rafi and Mrs. Calder prepared the lighthouse: they polished
            the lens, reinforced the tower, and stocked provisions. When the
            first blizzard crashed against the cliff, the light held steady. The
            villagers, warm in their cottages, watched the beam sweep across the
            sea and felt safe knowing the lighthouse&mdash;and its
            keepers&mdash;were still standing guard.
